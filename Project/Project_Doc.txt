5)Challenges Faced during the project
	-> How to get data Because it has to use some additonal feature than normal urllib2
	-> There were few alternatives Like Selenium, QtPy, Ghost, etc...
	-> In the end i came to conclusion to use Selenium after failure to rest of them.
		Here in selenium we are using firefox so firefox need to be installed on your machine and its binary means .exe is reuired.
	-> After this some geckon driver need to be installed which also took my effort.
		Then it got resolved.
		Now i am using.
			Python 2.7.13
			pip 9.0.1
			selenium 3.4.3
			geckonderiver 0.17 (Latest release) otherwise it will unexpectedly shut down with error code status:2
